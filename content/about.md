**Hi, I'm a.j.djalali**

I was born in El Paso, Texas. My father worked for [Marriott Hotels](https://www.marriott.com/), which meant our family moved — a lot. Growing up, home was never one place. It was wherever we unpacked next:

All that moving meant I attended three different high schools: [Western Albemarle](https://wah.k12albemarle.org/) in Virginia, [St. John's School](https://www.stjohnsguam.com/) in Guam, and [Hopkins High School](https://www.hopkinsschools.org/hopkins-high-school) in Minnesota, where I graduated. Each one dropped me into a completely different world — new people, new culture, new everything. You learn to adapt fast, or you don't adapt at all.

### The Academic Road

After high school I headed to [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), where I studied linguistics and discovered that language was something you could take apart and study with the same rigor people bring to math or physics. I graduated *Cum Laude* with Honors and was inducted into [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/).

From there I spent a year at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) as a [Fulbright](https://fulbrightscholars.org/) Fellow, studying mathematical logic, philosophy, and linguistics at the [Institute of Logic, Language, and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/). Amsterdam was formative — it sharpened the way I think about formal systems and gave me the foundation for what came next.

That next chapter was a PhD at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I worked on formal semantics and mathematical linguistics. My [dissertation](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:zd767rn6093/djalali_diss_final-augmented.pdf) tackled the syntax and semantics of ordinary comparative constructions in English — the kind of sentences everyone uses but no one thinks twice about.

### From Academia to Industry and Back

Toward the end of grad school I interned at [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/), which gave me my first taste of building language technology at scale. That led to [ClearGraph](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cleargraph), where I helped build natural language interfaces for data — work that caught [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)'s attention. They acquired ClearGraph, and I spent the next few years creating the NL technology behind [Ask Data](https://www.tableau.com/products/add-ons/natural-language). When Tableau was acquired by [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), I stayed on as a Software Engineering Architect and Principal Member of Technical Staff.

In 2023 I co-founded [PerceptivePanda](https://www.perceptivepanda.com/), an AI startup that was accepted into [StartX](https://startx.com/) '24. PerceptivePanda was [acquired by Zapier](https://zapier.com/) in 2025.

Today I'm **Research Faculty and Senior Research Engineer** at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I get to combine everything — linguistics, AI, and software engineering — under one roof.

For the full professional rundown, see my [Resume](/blog/cv/). My academic work is collected on the [Publications](/blog/publications/) page.

### Outside the Terminal

When I'm not writing code or reading papers, I'm usually deep in one of a few obsessions.

I ride a 2015 [Indian Scout](https://www.indianmotorcycle.com/) — there's nothing like two wheels and an open road to clear your head.

I'm a workwear and Japanese denim enthusiast. [Iron Heart](https://www.ironheart.co.uk/), [Momotaro](https://momotarojeans.net/), [Sugar Cane](https://www.sugarcanejeans.com/), [The Flat Head](https://www.theflathead.com/), [Studio D'Artisan](https://www.dartisan.co.jp/), [Samurai Jeans](https://samurai-j.com/) on the Japanese denim side; [Levi's](https://www.levi.com/), [Lee](https://www.lee.com/), [Wrangler](https://www.wrangler.com/), and [Dickies](https://www.dickies.com/) for the American classics; [Filson](https://www.filson.com/), [Pendleton](https://www.pendleton-usa.com/), [Ginew](https://ginew.com/), [Schott NYC](https://www.schottnyc.com/), [Buzz Rickson's](https://www.buzzricksons.com/), [Red Wing](https://www.redwingshoes.com/), [Master Supply Co](https://mastersupplyco.com/), and [Vans](https://www.vans.com/) for heritage workwear and everyday staples. If it's built to last and gets better with age, I'm interested.

I collect guitars — electrics and acoustics, old and new. And I'm an audiophile and vinyl collector, always hunting for the right pressing of the right record to play through the right setup.
