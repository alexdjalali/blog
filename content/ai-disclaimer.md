## AI Transparency

I use AI tools — primarily [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) — in my writing and development workflow. I believe in being transparent about it.

Every blog post on this site includes an **AI badge** next to the date and reading time:

- <i class="fa-solid fa-thumbs-up" style="color: #27ae60;"></i> **AI** — This post was written with AI assistance. I directed the content, provided the ideas and context, and edited the output. The AI helped with drafting and structure.

- <i class="fa-solid fa-thumbs-down" style="color: #c0392b;"></i> **AI** — This post was written without AI assistance.

### What "AI assistance" means here

AI assistance does not mean I typed a prompt and published whatever came back. It means I used AI as a collaborator in the writing process — the same way I use it in my [development workflow](/blog/posts/how-i-learned-to-love-the-bomb/). I provide the ideas, the facts, the opinions, and the direction. The AI helps with drafting, phrasing, and structure. I review, edit, and approve everything that gets published.

The site itself — layout, styling, JavaScript, and infrastructure — was also built with AI assistance. The footer credits "a.j.djalali+claude" to reflect this.

### Why disclose this

Because trust matters more than convenience. Readers deserve to know how content was produced. I'd rather over-disclose than leave anyone guessing.
