    <span class="pub-abstract">Handling ambiguity and underspecification in user utterances is a core challenge for natural language interfaces that support visual analytical tasks. This paper introduces a system that resolves partial utterances using syntactic and semantic constraints of the underlying analytical expressions, extending inferencing based on best practices in information visualization to generate useful visualization responses. Heuristics constrain the solution space of possible inferences, and ranking logic orders interpretations by relevancy and analytical usefulness.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">Partial Order Optimality Theory (PoOT) is a conservative generalization of classical Optimality Theory that enables the modeling of free variation and quantitative regularities without numerical parameters. Solving the ranking problem for PoOT&mdash;given a finite set of input/output pairs, how can a speaker learn the set of all grammars compatible with the data?&mdash;had remained an outstanding problem. This paper provides set-theoretic means for constructing the actual set of grammars compatible with an arbitrary dataset, thereby offering the first constructive solution to the PoOT ranking problem.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This talk argues that the mass/count distinction is neither directly observed in the world nor a matter of arbitrary linguistic convention, but rather a contrast in conceptualization. The analysis develops a conceptual-epistemic perspective on model-theoretic semantics, proposing that a level of conceptual representation mediates the relation between natural language and the world, with implications for how formal models should be interpreted.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper examines the logical foundations of MacCartney and Manning's natural logic system (NatLog), an algorithmic approach that combines insights from monotonicity calculi and syllogistic fragments to compositionally derive inferential relations between natural language sentences. The central contribution is a rigorous logical analysis showing that the system's table of lexical-semantic relations&mdash;including synonymy, antonymy, and hypernymy&mdash;has the underlying form of a syllogistic fragment and relies on a sort of generalized transitive reasoning. The work bridges proof-based semantic approaches with classical logical inference, providing theoretical grounding for computational natural language inference.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper presents a graph-theoretic model of discourse based on the Questions Under Discussion (QUD) framework, in which questions and assertions are treated as edges connecting discourse states in a rooted graph. The amount of common ground presupposed by interlocutors at any point corresponds to graphical depth. Using a new task-oriented dialogue corpus, the authors show that experts, presuming a richer common ground, initiate discourse at a deeper level than novices, enabling the quantification of speaker experthood relative to a fixed domain.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper addresses the apparent free variation between accusative and partitive case in Finnish, arguing that case assignment is a function of the lexical semantics of the verb, its object, and their composition. The key semantic distinction is existential commitment: verbs assigning accusative case entail the existence of their object's referent, while partitive-assigning verbs lack this commitment. The analysis shows that appeals to telicity and boundedness alone do not correctly predict Finnish stative behavior, and that existential commitment, encoded via meaning postulates, yields a more complete account of semantically conditioned case.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper presents the Cards corpus of task-oriented dialogues and demonstrates how it can inform the study of goal- and preference-driven discourse interpretation. The authors report on experimental studies involving underspecified referential expressions and quantifier domain restriction, showing that the task itself gives rise to a notion of relevance that powerfully predicts both where speakers use underspecified expressions and how those expressions are interpreted. The findings support a model in which players' evolving approach to the central objective shapes their pragmatic strategies.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper establishes robust connections between MacCartney's NatLog system and linguistic theory by reformulating natural logic as a formal proof system. The authors rethink NatLog as a sequent calculus and prove completeness via representation, grounding the system's compositional approach to textual entailment in rigorous logical foundations. The work also explores redefining the semantics using large corpora, with applications to sentiment analysis and veridicality.</span>

Noun type, constructions, and the universal grinder."</span> <span class="pub-extra"><em>Proceedings of the 37th Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society</em>. 2011.</span> <a href="/blog/bib/djalali2011grinder.bib" class="bib-link" download target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BibTeX</a>
    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper examines constraints on the Universal Grinder, a coercion mechanism whereby count nouns surface as mass expressions in particular morphosyntactic contexts. The analysis argues against an unconstrained contextualist hypothesis, showing that noun type&mdash;defined by the ontological properties of a noun's denotation&mdash;systematically constrains which nouns can undergo grinding. The result is an account in which the interaction between noun type and construction determines the availability of mass interpretations for count nouns.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper identifies three factors that jointly determine the mass/count status of nominals: the extension of a noun's denotation, the ontological type of the entities in that extension, and the morphosyntactic class of the noun. The analysis argues that no single factor is sufficient to predict countability, and that the interaction among all three ingredients is required to account for the full range of cross-linguistic variation in the mass/count distinction.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper investigates whether speakers can systematically distinguish between what is said and what is implicated. Using a novel experimental paradigm in which subjects evaluate sentences from the perspective of a strictly literal interpreter, the authors show that inferences from gradable adjectives are less frequently incorporated into truth-conditional meaning than those from quantifiers, cardinal numerals, and rank orderings. The gradience of the data suggests that a more nuanced account of the relationship between generalized conversational implicatures and truth conditions is needed.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper explores the integration of probabilistic reasoning into the framework of dynamic semantics, where meaning is characterized in terms of its potential to change the information state of a discourse context. The work develops a formal model that extends classical dynamic semantic frameworks with probability distributions, enabling the representation and computation of graded inferences in natural language. The approach provides a unified treatment of categorical and probabilistic inference within a single compositional system.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper investigates how prosodic focus affects bridging inferences in discourse comprehension. A perception experiment tests the effects of shifting prosody on potentially ambiguous bridging inferences, finding that listeners systematically vary their referent assignment based on heavy focus on specific lexical items. The results suggest that bridging and contrastive inferences pattern similarly, indicating an underlying connection between the two phenomena that may be captured by a formal theory of discourse and context.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper investigates whether scale type (open vs. closed) and salience of alternatives affect the strength of scalar implicature. The experimental results show that expression type&mdash;numerals, quantifiers and modals, and gradable adjectives&mdash;is a more reliable predictor of implicature strength than boundedness. The gradience of the data challenges the assumption that scalar implicature is a uniform phenomenon and motivates a more nuanced account of the relationship between generalized conversational implicatures and truth conditions.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This paper addresses the theoretical distinction between context-dependent and context-independent aspects of utterance interpretation, a standard assumption in current theories of meaning. The authors empirically investigate whether speakers can systematically distinguish these aspects, examining possible contextual and grammatical factors that influence the degree of incorporation and the strength of conversational implicatures. The findings suggest that the distinction between what is said and what is implicated is gradient rather than categorical.</span>

    <span class="pub-abstract">This dissertation argues that standard degree-based analyses of comparative constructions in English are fundamentally flawed and develops an alternative account grounded in Barker and Shan's continuation semantics and Muskens' simplified Montague logic. Rather than treating degrees as proper objects in the semantic ontology, the work proposes a transparent and minimal semantic representation language that avoids the complex covert operators typically posited in comparative syntax. The resulting framework provides a more empirically adequate and formally elegant treatment of ordinary comparatives while dispensing with the unnecessary machinery of traditional degree semantics.</span>
