# Story 3.1 — Create About Page with Bio

**Epic**: 3 — Content Creation **Points**: 3 **Status**: Todo

---

## Story

**As a** blog visitor, **I want** an About page with Alex's professional biography, **So that** I can learn about the author's background, research interests, and career.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- `content/about.md` created with front matter:
  ```yaml
  title: "About"
  date: 2026-02-21
  draft: true
  type: "page"
  ```
- Content covers:
  - Professional summary: CTO & Co-Founder of PerceptivePanda (AI micro-interview platform)
  - Academic background: Stanford PhD in Linguistics (2009-2014), Fulbright Scholar
  - Research interests: NLP, computational semantics, natural logic, AI
  - Career trajectory: Stanford → ClearGraph → Tableau/Salesforce → PerceptivePanda
  - Link to CV page (`/cv/`)
- All content sourced from publicly available information
- `draft: true` — content must not appear in production builds until reviewed
- Page renders at `/about/` with `hugo server --buildDrafts`
- No broken internal links

**Testing**: Visual verification:

- `hugo server --buildDrafts` — `/about/` renders with complete bio
- All internal links work
- Page uses Hugo Coder's `page` layout
