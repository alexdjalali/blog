# Story 3.2 — Create Publications Page

**Epic**: 3 — Content Creation **Points**: 2 **Status**: Complete

---

## Story

**As a** blog visitor, **I want** a Publications page listing Alex's academic work, **So that** I can find and cite his research contributions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- `content/publications.md` created with front matter:
  ```yaml
  title: "Publications"
  date: 2026-02-21
  draft: true
  type: "page"
  ```
- Single curated Markdown page (not a Hugo list/section)
- Each publication entry includes: authors, title, venue, year, and links (PDF/DOI where available)
- At least 2 known publications:
  - Work with Christopher Potts on natural logic and proof calculus
  - QUD discourse modeling with David Clausen, Sven Lauer, Christopher Potts
- `draft: true` — Alex must verify completeness before publishing
- Page renders at `/publications/` with `--buildDrafts`
- Navigation link resolves correctly

**Testing**: Visual verification:

- `hugo server --buildDrafts` — `/publications/` renders with publication entries
- Publication entries are properly formatted
- Navigation menu link works
