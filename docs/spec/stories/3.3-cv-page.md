**Epic**: 3 — Content Creation **Points**: 2 **Status**: Todo

## Story

**As a** blog visitor, **I want** a CV page with Alex's professional history, **So that** I can see his education, experience, and skills at a glance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- `content/cv.md` created with front matter:
  ```yaml
  title: "CV"
  date: 2026-02-21
  draft: true
  type: "page"
  ```
- Structured sections:
  - **Education:** Stanford PhD in Linguistics (2009-2014), BA + Fulbright
  - **Experience:** PerceptivePanda (CTO & Co-Founder, 2021-present), Salesforce/Tableau, ClearGraph (VP NL Engineering), Nuance Communications, Stanford University
  - **Research Interests:** NLP, AI, computational semantics, natural logic, discourse modeling
  - **Skills:** Python, NLP, AI/ML, software engineering
- All content sourced from publicly available information
- `draft: true` — Alex must review for accuracy and completeness
- Page renders at `/cv/` with `--buildDrafts`
- Navigation link resolves correctly
- Note: User can later replace with external link by changing menu URL in `hugo.toml`

**Testing**: Visual verification:

- `hugo server --buildDrafts` — `/cv/` renders with all sections
- Navigation menu link works
- Content is well-structured with clear headings
