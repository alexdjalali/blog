# Story 3.4 — Write Sample Blog Posts

**Epic**: 3 — Content Creation **Points**: 3 **Status**: Todo

---

## Story

**As a** blog visitor, **I want** sample blog posts that demonstrate the blog's content structure and populate taxonomy pages, **So that** the blog feels complete and navigation through tags/categories works.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Post 1: `content/posts/hello-world.md`
  - Title: "Hello World"
  - Introductory post about the blog, what to expect, Alex's background
  - Tags: `["blog", "personal"]`
  - Categories: `["meta"]`
  - 200-400 words
  - `draft: true`
- Post 2: `content/posts/on-natural-logic.md`
  - Title: "On Natural Logic and Computational Semantics"
  - Brief post on Alex's research area
  - Tags: `["nlp", "linguistics", "research"]`
  - Categories: `["research"]`
  - 200-400 words
  - `draft: true`
- Front matter format for both:
  ```yaml
  title: "Post Title"
  date: 2026-02-21T00:00:00-05:00
  draft: true
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
  categories: ["category"]
  description: "Brief description for SEO"
  ```
- Use single-word tags only (avoid Hugo Coder multi-word tag bug #980)
- Posts render at `/posts/hello-world/` and `/posts/on-natural-logic/` with `--buildDrafts`
- Tags from posts appear on `/tags/` page
- Categories from posts appear on `/categories/` page
- Post list at `/posts/` shows both entries with dates and reading time

**Testing**: Build and visual verification:

- `hugo --buildDrafts` — build succeeds with no errors
- `hugo server --buildDrafts` — posts render, taxonomy pages populated
- `/tags/` shows: blog, personal, nlp, linguistics, research
- `/categories/` shows: meta, research
