## Blog Posts

- [The Ideal Repository Structure](https://alexdjalali.github.io/blog/posts/the-ideal-repository-structure/): How strict layer boundaries prevent architectural decay — a deep-dive into interface-first, layered monorepo design with Go and Python examples.
- [How I Learned to Love the Bomb](https://alexdjalali.github.io/blog/posts/how-i-learned-to-love-the-bomb/): A developer's journey from AI skepticism to building an entire engineering system around it. Adapt or die — and what adaptation actually looks like.
- [The Decorator Pattern for Observability and Resilience](https://alexdjalali.github.io/blog/posts/decorator-pattern-observability-resilience/): How the decorator pattern cleanly separates logging, metrics, retry, and circuit breaking from business logic — with examples in Python and Go.
- [From Dependency Parses to Montague Semantics via Vector-Grounded Concept Bases](https://alexdjalali.github.io/blog/posts/dependency-to-lambda/): Exploring how Universal Dependencies parse trees, Montague-style typed lambda calculus, and vector-derived concept bases fit together into a compositional semantics pipeline.
- [My Development Environment](https://alexdjalali.github.io/blog/posts/my-development-environment/): A walkthrough of a macOS development setup: zsh, neovim, tmux, and 80+ CLI tools — all managed from a single dotfiles repo with a one-command install.
